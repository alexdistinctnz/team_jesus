## Why This Matters

**Biblical Foundation**

Scripture calls us to share the Gospel and make disciples of all nations.

### Verses:

1. **The Great Commission** (Matthew 28:19–20)
   - Jesus commanded His followers to go and make disciples of all nations, teaching them to obey everything He commanded.

2. **Fishers of Men** (Matthew 4:19)
   - Jesus calls us to follow Him and become fishers of men, actively bringing others into relationship with God.

3. **They Must Hear** (Romans 10:14)
   - How can people believe in Him of whom they have not heard? Faith comes from hearing the message of Christ.

4. **Obedience** (John 14:15; Jeremiah 7:23)
   - If you love Jesus, you will keep His commands. Obey Him and walk in the ways He has commanded.

5. **Consequences of Silence** (Ezekiel 3:18; Matthew 25:41; 13:50)
   - God holds us accountable for warning the wicked. Those who reject Him face eternal separation from God.

2. **Authority Over Cities** (Luke 19:17–19)

3. **Sit with Christ** (Revelation 3:21)
   - Those who overcome will be given the right to sit with Jesus on His throne, just as He overcame and sat with the Father.

4. **Inheritance** (Colossians 3:23–24; 1 Peter 1:4)
